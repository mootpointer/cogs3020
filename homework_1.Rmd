## 1. The Hodgkin-Huxley model

* How important is `tau`? Try a few different values (e.g.,
0.01, 0.05, 0.075, 1). What's up with that?

* Simulate a HH neuron for a total time of 15 ms and inject
a DC current of $2 \frac{\mu A}{cm^2}$ for the duration of
the simulation. Show a plot that superimposes NA$^+$ and
k$^+$ conductance along with the membrane potential.

* Simulate a HH neuron for a total time of 100 ms and inject
a current of $4 \frac{\mu A}{cm^2}$ during the middle third
of the simulation.

* Show that applying a DC current to the model is equivalent
to changing $E_{leak}$.

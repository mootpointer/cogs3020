## What is computational neuroscience?

* Computational neuroscience is just using computers to
study brains.

* What counts as *brains* has come to refer to pretty much
anything across a very wide range of levels. E.g.,

  * Biochemical and electrical signal transduction and
  prorogation within individual cell compartments.
  
  * Intracellular signalling cascades.
  
  * Whole cell action potential spiking properties.
  
  * Collection of neurons as dynamical systems.
  
  * Local field potential, hemodynamic response, cortical
  oscillatory patterns.
  
  * Behaviour (e.g., decision making, action selection and
  execution)
  
* Using computers to study purely neural systems -- without
concern for behaviour -- is pretty fairly called
*computational neuroscience*.

* Using computers to study behaviour -- without concern for
neural systems -- would fall more naturally under the banner
of *cognitive modelling*.

* Using computers to study how the brain drives behaviour --
i.e., explicitly caring about both neural and cognitive
domains and trying to link them  -- is sometimes given
special names like *computational cognitive neuroscience*.


## Marr's levels

* **Computational**: A specification of what a system does
and why it does it.

* **Algorithmic**: A specification of how it does what it
does (i.e., what process is followed).

* **implementational**: A specification of how the system is
implemented in the brain.

* In my opinion, few models cleanly reside at a single one
of these levels and many probably are best classified
between levels. Even so, the conceptual divisions they get
us thinking about are useful to have on hand.


## Why computers?

* Mathematics is at the heart of computational neuroscience.

* The goal is to write down equations that formally describe
the process through which the phenomena of interest are
hypothesised to emerge.

* The need for computers arises when the mathematics that
you write down is complicated and difficult to evaluate.

* Computational approaches give us tools to deal with these
difficult mathematical situations. Well, some of them at
least.


## What is the real value gained? 

* Have you ever stuggled or argued with yourelf or others
about what a certain hypothesis predicts in a particular
experiment?

* Mathematical precision makes science happy. It eliminates
ambiguity and thereby makes mathematical models more
falsifiable.

* In practice, the word *more* in the last sentence above
can do an awful lot of work. Coming up with experiments that
are strong tests of any model, even mathematically precise
models, can be very difficult.

* Even so, there is no question that mathematics and
computers help... and sometimes they help a whole lot.


## Why Python
* It is a real programming language
* It is mature
* It is widely embraced in psychology and neuroscience
* It is widely embraced inside and outside academia 
* It is widely used in the machine learning community
* It is relatively easy to learn


## Getting started with Python

* I recommend getting started with
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

* Anaconda will provide the IDE
[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org) which will be a good
place for most of you to start working with Python.

* However, there are many Python programming tools to choose
from. Use what you like.


## Learning Python

* Just like with other programming languages you have been
exposed to, the base functionality of Python is extended by
external libraries. We will make heavy use of the following
libraries:

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org)

  * [Learn Numpy](https://numpy.org/learn/)

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)

  * [Learn Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html)

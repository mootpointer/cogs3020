## Weekly Lectures

- Please see [lectures](lectures.html)

- Course content will be delivered with agility. We will
slow down or speed up as need and want demands.

## Course Philosophy
**Python competency**: We will spend a little time working
together to learn `Python` but I will be moving faster than
I do in my second year statistics unit where many of you
might have learned `R`. This course assumes you have a solid
enough programming background to pick up Python as we go.

**Computational literacy**: The main objective of the course
is for you to be able to spend time with published
computational modelling papers, and replicate most or all of
the results in those papers. This is a super power among
cognitive neuroscientist.

## Performance Evaluation
- 10% quizzes
- 30% problem sets
- 30% midterm exam
- 30% final exam

**Quizzes**: 10 short online multiple quizzes designed to
provide routine assessment and feedback. Graded on
credit/no-credit basis. The 2 lowest quizzes (missed or
marked non-credit) may be dropped without penalty. These
will not be hard. They are simple nudges to motivate you to
study lecture notes **before** lecture begins.

**Problem sets**: These are where most of your learning will
occur. They will require hard work and it is essential that
you take them seriously and commit adequate time to them.
They will closely follow the lecture notes.

**Midterm exam**: This will take the form of a 1 page
proposal in which you choose a computational model from the
literature and choose key results from this paper that you
will replicate for the final exam.

**Final exam**: This will take the form of a final report
and / or presentation to the class (class size and time
allowing) about a computational model from the literature
that you selected as part of your midterm exam. You will be
responsible for replicating key findings from this paper
with code that you have written from scratch.
